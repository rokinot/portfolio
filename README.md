# Portfolio

I've been a crypto user since 2020, taking some interest in DeFi, and previously worked for Yearn Finance, doing technical writing and translation.

In 2022, I discovered Code4rena and have been part-timing on-and-off some of the contests, as well as other platforms such as Hats Finance/Cantina. In 2024 I finished my B.Sc in Computer Engineering and since 2025 I've returned to work with security research full time. I have also participated in some of the Secureum challenges, placing in the top 10 on RACE-12, as well as top twice 20 on Secureumâ€™s RACE-29 and RACE-10.

# Highlights

Some of my best performances in the public contest environment. 

| Competition              | Ranking | Reward | Description |
| :---------------- | :------: | ---- | ---- |
| Hats Finance V2 |  #1   | $25.000 | Hats Finance V2 protocol is designed to give white hats hackers the opportunity to gain more on their good behaviour and contribution. Trying to tilt the balance of incentives, and incentivizing more hackers to act responsively. It is doing so by letting projects publish on-chain bounties for their protocols, with committees in-charge of approving or rejecting claims. To further increase the efficiency of this model, the HAT token is introduced, to help bootstrap both ends in this two-sided market.
| Ion Protocol           |   #5   | $797.5 | Ion Protocol is a decentralized money market purpose-built for all types of staked and restaked assets. Ion protocol unlocks capital efficiency for yield-bearing staking collaterals using reactive interest rates, collateral-specific utilization, and price-agnostic liquidations. Borrowers can collateralize their yield-bearing staking assets to borrow WETH, and lenders can gain exposure to the boosted staking yield generated by borrower collateral. |
| Lodestar Finance    |  #7   | $527.7 | The Lodestar Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain supply capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) to receive cTokens or borrow assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The Lodestar cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
| Venus Prime        |   #15   | $327.81 | Venus Protocol is excited to announce Venus Prime, a revolutionary incentive program aimed to bolster user engagement and growth within the protocol. An integral part of Venus Tokenomics v3.1, Venus Prime aims to enhance rewards and promote $XVS staking, focusing on markets including USDT, USDC, BTC and ETH.
| VTVL | #15 | $416.87 | VTVL is a token management platform for web3 founders. The core function of VTVL is to allow users to generate and deploy token vesting smart contracts through our platform.

# Private audits

In 2024, I partnered with Guardian Audits in securing a few protocols.
