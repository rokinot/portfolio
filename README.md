# Introduction

👋 I am rokinot, a security researcher on his last semester of a B.Sc for Computer Engineering with a strong foundations on statistics and embedded systems. 

I began participating in audits contests for Code4rena as well as Hats Finance on a part time basis, then took a break to focus on my degree. Since 2025 I've began to work with security research full time on multiple platforms: Cantina, Code4rena, Sherlock, Codehawks, and have had some of the best performances in public contests in the past few months. I have [a blog](https://rokinot.github.io/) where I write about some of my best, as well as some of my favorite vulnerabilities found.

Every time I finish a review, I re-evaluate my auditing process I took, review all findings missed and assess what was missed in my methodology. 

# Private work

In 2024, I was invited by Guardian Audits to participate in the security assessment of a few protocols. I'll update their reports whenever they are published but its been a while already so who knows.
