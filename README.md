# Portfolio

I've been a crypto user since 2020, taking some interest in DeFi, and previously worked for Yearn Finance, doing technical writing and translation.

In 2022, I discovered Code4rena and have been part-timing on-and-off some of the contests, as well as other platforms such as Hats Finance/Cantina. Since 2025 I've returned to work with security research full time. I have also participated in some of the Secureum challenges, placing in the top 10 on RACE-12, as well as top twice 20 on Secureumâ€™s RACE-29 and RACE-10.
